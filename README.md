# N-gram Text Predictor

Welcome to the **N-gram Text Predictor** project! This project is designed to predict the next word in a sequence of text using N-gram models. It is a simple yet powerful tool for understanding and implementing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically focusing on probabilistic language models.

## Introduction

The N-gram Text Predictor is a probabilistic model that uses N-grams (sequences of N words) to predict the next word in a sentence. It is based on the idea that the probability of a word depends on the previous N-1 words. This project demonstrates how to build, train, and use an N-gram model for text prediction.

## Features

- **N-gram Model**: Supports unigram, bigram, trigram, and higher-order N-gram models.
- **Text Prediction**: Predicts the next word based on the input sequence.
- **Customizable**: Allows you to specify the value of N for the N-gram model.
- **Training on Custom Data**: Train the model on any text corpus of your choice.
- **Smoothing Techniques**: Includes basic smoothing techniques to handle unseen N-grams.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/n-gram-text-predictor.git
   cd n-gram-text-predictor
Install dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required packages:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the project:
Follow the instructions in the Usage section to train and use the model.

Usage
Training the Model
To train the N-gram model on a text corpus, use the following command:

bash
Copy
python train.py --corpus_path path/to/your/corpus.txt --n 3
--corpus_path: Path to the text file containing the training data.

--n: The value of N for the N-gram model (e.g., 2 for bigram, 3 for trigram).

Making Predictions
To predict the next word in a sequence, use the following command:

bash
Copy
python predict.py --input "Your input text here"
--input: The input text sequence for which you want to predict the next word.

Example
bash
Copy
python predict.py --input "I love"
Output:

Copy
Predicted next word: programming
How It Works
N-gram Extraction: The text corpus is split into N-grams of the specified length.

Probability Calculation: The probability of each N-gram is calculated based on its frequency in the corpus.

Prediction: Given an input sequence, the model predicts the next word by selecting the most probable N-gram that matches the input.

Smoothing
To handle cases where an N-gram is not present in the training data, basic smoothing techniques (e.g., Laplace smoothing) are applied.
